COMM.TXT   
ASCII Text version of simple RS-232 COMM program. Use F-keys to adjust baud rate.

DISKT106.PAS
Turbo Pascal 4.0 compatible code to disk disk write/read speed, from the 
perspective of a typical DOS application (that would also be allocating
the content to be saved into RAM).
TP2 and TP3 didn't yet suport the WORD type, and also only produced
.COM executables with more limited memory allocation restrictions.

HELLO.ASM
x86 code for Microsoft Macro Assembler.  Remove the first line (.8086) to make 
it compatible with the original V1.10 version.  As is, this parses and compiles
for MACRO ASM 3.0

PIANO.BAS
PIANO.TXT
Tokenized and plain-text version of simple PIANO program, that assigns
frequencies to F-keys to play through the PC Speaker.  Notes are computed,
so you can use arrow keys to adjust the range.  (left/right for note index,
up/down to adjust Middle A frequency).  SPACEBAR to show status of all
the F-key assignments.

QMATH.EXE
Program I did in the 1990s to be a command line calculator.  The source
code has been lost (hard drive crash) but this does run under MS-DOS 2.0!
